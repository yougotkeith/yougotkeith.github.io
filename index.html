		<h1>Get to Know Me</h1>
		<h2>A little bit of history</h2>

		<p>I started working as a graphic designer about 15 years ago. Back then it was almost entirely print-related work. Magazine spreads, ads, corporate identity systems, business stationery, brochures, direct mail marketing campaigns; you name it. Even billboards and vehicle wraps!</p> 

		<p>The name of the game was strong concepts, design aesthetics, and knowing your stuff when it comes to print production, specialized prepress techniques, and output resolutions (<em>DPI</em> = dots-per-inch and specifies printing press output, <em>PPI</em> = pixels-per-inch and specifies image resolution. They are NOT the same.). Those were exciting times. Yet working with todays web and digital technologies has taken designers to places we never imagined we would go... and that is even more exciting.</p>

		<p>To sum things up, I have a lot of experience to bring to the table, including years of working with the <em>Adobe Creative Suite</em>, (now <em><a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html" target="_blank">Creative Cloud</a></em>) applications; with the latest additions to my toolset being the awesome <em><a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch" target="_blank">Sketch</a></em> (a modern digital design app) and <em><a href="http://invisionapp.com" target="_blank">InVision</a></em> (a prototyping web app). Both of which I enjoy immensely.</P> 

		<p>I do all my work from my <em>Mac/Macbook Pro</em>. I absolutely love learning the very latest web technologies, standards, and best practices. I take pride in creating high quality and engaging web, mobile, and digital experiences. I enjoy staying in the know on current design, UI, and UX trends to better understand what’s effective and what isn’t.</p>

			<div class="collapse-card__body">
				<p>So you may be wondering, am I a graphic designer, a web designer, a front-end web developer...? The answer is yes, I'm all three. I consider myself (and strive to be) a <span class="highlight">full-stack designer</span>. Being a full-stack designer means having an expanded skill set with deep knowledgeable about what can and cannot work elegantly within the context of a product’s design (brand identity, website, web/mobile app).</p>

				<p>I also believe in being a team member who can jump in and help even outside my area of focus. This is beneficial for clients who want to keep teams lean and diversified with everyone having a better grasp of the whole-picture.</p>

				<!-- <p>I believe the user interface should be carefully crafted around best practices, user testing, and common patterns that users can relate to intuitively.</p> -->

				<p>It seems to me that businesses and organizations are pivoting towards bringing design  to the center of their business process. As a result, I think stakeholders and executives are increasingly recognizing the value of UX design, and increasingly want to be involved. I know a number of designers who have varying viewpoints on this; but I consider it a good thing.</p>

				<p>I believe that the only proper way to design &amp; build a modern website is with a fully <em class="highlight">responsive</em>, <em class="highlight">mobile first</em> approach.</p>

				<h2 class="collapse-card__title">Clean Design, Clean Code</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="collapse-card__body">
				<p>So many websites suffer from poorly written markup. I believe in writing clean, semantically correct HTML, as well as lean, structured CSS. In my opinion, good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup.</p>

				<p>Besides eliminating buggy behavior and vastly improving a site or app's performance, clean, well structured code is easier to read and edit. Not to mention the benefits of improved Accessibility and Search Engine Optimization.</p>

				<p>Clean markup also saves time and money when other people have to interact with it. Especially if it needs to be integrated into a content management system or any other web application.</p>
